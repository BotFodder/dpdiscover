----[ Purpose

    This plugin attempts to find LLDP, CDP, and FDP information on
existing hosts via SNMP, and attempts to add unknown equipment to Cacti.

----[ Features

	Host Filter
	Displays Host Status
	Displays DNS Name
	Displays SNMP Status and Information
	Link to add device to Cacti.
	Allows Discovery Templates to allow adding the device to Cacti
	Detects and corrects IP changes
	Detects and corrects name changes

----[ Installation

	If you have not already done so, install the Plugin Architecture
	http://cactiusers.org/wiki/PluginArchitectureInstall

	Next install this Plugin using these directions

----[ Changelog

    --- 1.48 ---
    - Cleaned up some code for the (mostly ignored by me, but someone's using
      it) "discover" tab in dpdiscover.php.  There's a lot of cruft in there
      left over from the original "Auto Discovery" plugin.  I would assume at
      this point that that functionality is still quite buggy.  Report your
      experience and I'll fix what I can.
    --- 1.47 ---
    - Unnecessary line trying to do some weird crap with 'description' - not
      needed, so line commented out.  Best case, I was trying to change the
      'description' of a "known" host, which is not necessary.  Worst case,
      I was high or drunk.  And I don't drink or do drugs.  Error unnoticed
      until someone started using PHP 5.4.x.  It may get added in later in a
      more sane fashion if I figure out it is needed for some reason.
    --- 1.46 ---
    - findhost.php update to check the size of the templates - if < 1, exit.
    --- 1.45 ---
    - Finally came up with a way to hopefully eliminate start time drift; now
      the time saved to the DB as the "start" time of the last run is saved
      with a "minute" value based on the original "Start Time For Polling".
    --- 1.44 ---
    - Added some sanity checks at the beginning of "findhosts.php" so that if
      required things are missing, the check stops running.
    --- 1.43 ---
    - "disabled" hosts are completely ignored - they are not probed for *dp
      information.
    --- 1.42 ---
    - Some of the timing code was tweaked to hopefully have the findhosts.php
      job running more regularly.  Prior, over time there would be a delay in
      when the job would run.
    --- 1.41 ---
    - Name change code modified to be optional - see settings.
    --- 1.40 ---
    - Added code to detect a name change; if a discovery protocol reports a
      name that resolves to an IP, and the name is not found in the known
      devices but the IP is, the discovered name will replace the name of the
      known device.
    - Some Brocade devices (and possibly others, but in the development
      environment, it was only noticed on Brocades) will not "walk" properly
      (due to get_bulk_request) via SNMPv2 - hence, they will not report their
      neighboring devices.  Optional code (see "Settings" for DPDiscover) was
      written that will (if a device fails via LLDP, CDP, and FDP) rewalk a
      device via FDP and SNMPv1 (FDP must be 'on', LLDP and CDP not required
      to be 'on').

    --- 1.30 ---
    - Report page touched up a bit - Uptime code refined.  "last seen" value
      added.
    - "Clean out report database table" function fixed - wasn't mysqli
      compatible too.
    - Change to sysUptime table storage from int(32) to bigint(64) to store
      larger values.  Systems with more than 230 days runtime were not showing
      up properly.
    - SNMP values for Uptime, Location, etc. on report page should now be
      available for all known, added, and systems with identifiable SNMP
      values, but no compatible template.
    - Error on dpdiscover.php patched - I bungled an index value.

    --- 1.26 ---
    - The FDP setting had been removed somewhere along the line; added it back.
    - There was a 1.1, 1.2, and 1.25 before this that introduced some
      additional functionality, including discovery and repair of changed IPs.

    --- 1.0 ---
    - FDP!  Tested even.  Turns out we have Brocades that don't have LLDP on.
    - Code for IPv6 only hosts as hostnames added as "udp6:hostname.com". Not
      tested.

    --- 0.4 ---
    - IPv6 has been tested.  Code has been written so that, if using IP as the
      hostname, the IP is added as 'udp6:[IPv6::IP]'.  However, I think if you
      use the FQDN as the hostname, this won't work if there's no v4 address
      for the name (in other words, I'd have to add the FQDN as
      udp6:hostname.com for it to work, and that code isn't there yet).  IPv6
      operation may be heavily dependent on which SNMP you're using; Net-SNMP
      should work fine, but YMMV.
    - Options to use or not use LLDP or CDP are provided.  If both are
      selected, a host will be scanned with both (LLDP first, then CDP) no
      matter what the device returns with LLDP.  However, the code should
      operate in such a way as to only add a device once if it shows up in
      both LLDP and CDP.

    --- 0.3 ---
    - BUG FIX: findhosts.php was not reading in dpdiscover_parent_filter
      properly, so it would use parent without filtering.

    --- 0.2 ---
    - Report tab cleaned up.
    - Name unification - a lot less "dpdiscovery" than before.
    - Email report includes devices found, with valid IP, but not added or
      known.
    - Will take settings from 0.1, delete them, add them with new names

    --- 0.1 ---
    Initial release, based heavily on the original Auto Discovery plugin.
    This version only tries LLDP and (failing that), CDP.
